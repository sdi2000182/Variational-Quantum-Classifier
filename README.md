# Quantum Parity Check for Diabetes Dataset using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a Quantum Parity Check using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) for three tasks: performing a 3-bit parity check, testing the VQC on a 3-feature version of the Diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv), and expanding the model to classify 5-bit parity. The notebook demonstrates the application of VQCs to classical data and explores the potential of quantum machine learning for solving parity problems. To get started, open `vqc_parity_diabetes.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment and follow the instructions within the notebook.

The implementation uses PennyLane for constructing and simulating the quantum circuits.
