# Quantum Parity Check for Diabetes Dataset using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) for three tasks: performing a 3-bit parity check, testing the VQC on a 3-feature version of the Diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv), and expanding the model to classify 5-bit parity. The notebook demonstrates the application of VQCs to classical data and explores the potential of quantum machine learning for solving parity problems. 
The implementation uses PennyLane for constructing and simulating the quantum circuits.
